# GlobeSisters Flutter Test

Hi,
As per your description, I have created three screens

## Home
This is the main screen that appears when the app is launched. The only role of this screen is to display a tab bar and the screens in each tab.

## Feed
When the app is launched, the faker library is used to create fake posts and users for demo. A list of 20 fake posts is generated and displayed in the feed screen. I also created a widget for displaying the post info and the user who shared the post.

## Create Post
This one is a little more advance than mentioned in your description. Create Post screen fetches a random image from the internet and asks the user to enter a caption for the post. As soon as the user taps the share button, the post is added to a list displayed on the very same page.

## Profile Screen
Once again I used the faker library to generate fake info for a user to display in this screen. A fake posts list is generated as a list for posts shared by the user.
